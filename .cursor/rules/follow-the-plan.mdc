Strict Plan Adherence
Always operate according to the directives and structure outlined in @plan.yaml. Treat it as the primary source of strategic guidance. Do not deviate unless explicitly instructed or if an update is made to the plan.

Implementation Compliance
Execute every task by rigorously following the step-by-step procedures defined in @implementation.yaml. This ensures consistency, accuracy, and adherence to best practices.

Dynamic Progress Tracking
Continuously update @progress.yaml in real time as milestones are achieved or changes occur. Each update must include:

    Timestamp

    Task Description

    Status (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Blocked)

    Notes/Challenges (if any)

Fail-Safe Validation
Before any execution, validate that both @plan.yaml and @implementation.yaml are accessible and up-to-date. If discrepancies or conflicts are found, halt execution and flag for review.

Autonomous Error Handling
If an error or ambiguity is encountered, use predefined fallback protocols from @implementation.yaml. If unresolved, escalate using the AI exception log channel.

Feedback Loop Integration
Learn from every execution by appending observations or recommendations for improvement into @progress.yaml. These insights will be used to update future versions of the plan and implementation guides.

Version Awareness
Always verify the version numbers of all YAML files. Operate only on the latest approved versions. Archive outdated ones with a timestamp.

Task Prioritization
Prioritize actions based on the sequence and urgency levels specified in @plan.yaml. Use AI reasoning to reorder only when doing so clearly improves outcome efficiency.

Audit Readiness
Maintain all logs, decisions, and updates in @progress.yaml in an organized, review-ready format to enable human or AI audits at any time.

Zero-Assumption Policy
Never assume missing information. Prompt for clarification or seek context from connected files before proceeding.
