# Project Plan: AI-Powered Content Repurposing Platform

## Vision & Business Goals
- Transform long-form content (podcasts, webinars, meetings) into high-quality, personalized derivative content at scale.
- Provide both written (articles, summaries, show notes) and media assets (video reels, audiograms).
- Serve content creators, agencies, B2B marketers, and podcast producers.
- Achieve scalable, profitable SaaS operations with a user-friendly, self-serve platform.

## User Personas
- **Content Creators:** Individuals producing podcasts, webinars, or video content.
- **Agencies:** Marketing and content agencies managing multiple clients.
- **B2B Marketers:** Teams repurposing webinars, meetings, and events for lead generation.
- **Podcast Producers:** Professionals seeking to scale show notes, summaries, and promotional assets.

## Core Features (MVP)
- Upload/ingest audio, video, or text content
- AI-powered transcription (speech-to-text)
- Summarization and content extraction (articles, show notes, highlights)
- Media asset generation (video reels, audiograms)
- User dashboard for managing projects and assets
- Export/share/download options for all content types
- User authentication and account management

## Technical Requirements
- **Frontend:** Modern JS framework (React, Next.js, or similar)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express, Python (for AI), or serverless (e.g., AWS Lambda)
- **AI/ML:** Integrate with or build models for transcription (e.g., Whisper, AssemblyAI), summarization (OpenAI, custom LLM), and media generation (FFmpeg, audiogram libraries)
- **Storage:** Cloud storage for uploads and generated assets (AWS S3, GCP, etc.)
- **Database:** Scalable DB for user/projects (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or managed service)
- **Authentication:** OAuth, email/password, or third-party (Auth0, Firebase Auth)
- **Payments:** Stripe or similar for SaaS billing
- **Integrations:** (Optional for MVP) YouTube, Zoom, Dropbox, Google Drive
- **Deployment:** CI/CD, Docker, cloud hosting (Vercel, AWS, GCP)
